GENERAL
=====================

To study the level of contention, this test tries to find the no of cycles a writer wastes inorder to get hold of the lock. The datastructure used is the task_struct->thread_group linked list. The system was running at a fixed frequency of 2800MHz.

The patch provided must be applied to kernel version 4.4.15 and compiled before continuing.

To run the entire profiler, simply execute:
./run_it.sh [#process_name] [#module_name] [#duration] [#type] [#periodic-gap]

#module_name should be a new name not in the directory.
#process_name is the process for which the threads are being profiled.
#type denotes the datastructure to profile.
[1: thread_group, 2: fdtable struct]

To do things individually, check the following
Compile the module using make and run the module with params:
insmod pro_mod.ko pid_tmp=[#pid] timeX=[#duration] typex=[#type]

The dmesg output can be taken as:
dmesg | grep 'pro mod #pid' > logX

The final contetnion data should be calculated after compiling profileX.c and executing:
./profileX.out [#duration] [#cur-periodic-gap] < logX > plotData

Now run 'gnuplot conPlot.plot' to visualize the data
