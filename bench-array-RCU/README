GENERAL
=====================

To test the effect of using array based semantics rather than list based semantics for
small node sizes, the benchamrk has been updated to include an RCU protected array. 

Note: The test results can be found inside 'TestRes' directory.

To run all bench tests, execute:
./run_all.sh

To run the new bench tests, execute:
./testX.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file arcu] [# file rcu]

For individual cases 
./rcu_test.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rcu]
./arcu_test.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file arcu]

To plot the data generated, execute:
gnuplot plotX.plot [Note: plotX.plot must be edited for the perfect plot]
