DS COUNT [BASED ON LIST SEMANTICS]
====================================

Simply execute ./main.sh and get the DS count(subdivided by semantics)

Note:
findRCU.c removes duplicate list entries.
'log' contains all *_rcu entries in the linux kernel v4.4
The log has been taken from http://www.rdrop.com/~paulmck/RCU/linuxusage/linux-4.4.rcua
