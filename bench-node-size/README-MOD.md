GENERAL
=====================

To test the effect of node size, the benchmark provided by the RLU Authors was 
modified to suit the purpose. The makefile has another field nsize that updates
the node size during: make nsize=[# pad size]

To run the new bench tests, execute:
./test.sh [# npages] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rcu] [# file rlu]

For individual cases 
./rcu_test.sh [# npages] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rcu]
./rlu_test.sh [# npages] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rlu]

To plot the data generated, execute:
gnuplot plotX.plot [Note: plotX.plot must be edited for the perfect plot]

The original benchmark can be found here: https://github.com/rlu-sync/rlu
