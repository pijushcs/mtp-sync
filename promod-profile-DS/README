GENERAL
=====================

This test tries to find the no of cycles a writer wastes inorder to get hold of the lock.
The datastructure used is the tfile->f_ep_links linked list under the fs subsystem. 
The system was running at a fixed frequency of 2800MHz.

The result can be seen at: 'pro-con.png'

The patch provided must be applied to kernel version 4.4.15 and compiled before continuing.
promod_define.h has been added to easily add profiling hooks in the kernel.

To run the entire profiler, simply execute:
./main.sh [#duration] [#periodic-gap]

To do things individually, check the following

The dmesg output can be taken as:
dmesg | grep 'promod #type' > logX

Note: #type is the DS id to be profiled

The final contetnion data should be calculated after compiling profileX.c and executing:
./profileX.out [#cur-periodic-gap] < logX > plotData

Note: #cur-gap can be 1 for individual output

Now run 'gnuplot conPlot.plot' to visualize the data
