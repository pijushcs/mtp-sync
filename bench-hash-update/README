GENERAL
=====================

To test the effect of simple node updates rather than insertions-deletions, the
benchmark provided by the RLU Authors was modified to suit the purpose.

To run the new bench tests, execute:
./test.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rcu] [# file rlu]

For individual cases 
./rcu_test.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rcu]
./rlu_test.sh [# therads] [# buckets] [# wset] [# update rate] [# file rlu]

To run all bench tests, execute:
./run_all.sh

To plot the data generated, execute:
gnuplot plotX.plot [Note: plotX.plot must be edited for the perfect plot]

The original benchmark can be found here: https://github.com/rlu-sync/rlu
