GENERAL
=====================
The list of such DS can be found in 'DS_accessed' sorted on basis of access rate.

The patch provided must be applied to kernel version 4.4.15 and compiled before continuing.
The system when started with the new kernel logs every access to all RCU lists.

To kernel is updated using the following script:
./promod_add.sh from the linux source with promod_add.awk on the same directory.

This script browses the entire kernel source for files and add logging statements before 
RCU list statements using 'promod_add.awk'. This is done to find the most accessed 
RCU-list DS in the Linux Kernel. 

On the system with the new kernel, simply execute:
dmesg --read-clear > log
./promod_DS.out < log > DS_accessed

This gives the list of RCU DS accessed in the kernel just before the above execution.
